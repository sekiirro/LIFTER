# Analyze: F12 Registration approval and payments

- **Date:** 2026-11-03
- **Analysed commit:** `d04ef52eb93df68b9361106a5ee4fd4fcaebb108` (origin/main baseline; this artifact follows the local spec/task reconciliation)
- **Scope:** static consistency and evidence review; no test suites executed.
- **Entry inventory:** `spec.md` (FR-001..029, SC-001..011, acceptance scenarios); `plan.md`, `tasks.md`, `research.md`, `data-model.md`, `contracts/*`, `quickstart.md`, `checklists/requirements.md`; clarifications recorded in `spec.md`; no prior `analyze.md` or `traceability.md`.

## Findings

| ID | Severity | Artifact | Finding | Disposition |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| F12-A01 | MEDIUM | `tasks.md:T051` | The planned migration filename was stale; the shipped migration is `20261101131000_flexible_registration_link_terms_forward.sql`. | Corrected to the exact shipped filename; migration exists on the analysed commit. |
| F12-A02 | MEDIUM | `tasks.md:T053`, `tests/unit/registration-links-flexible-ui.test.ts` | The task names a UI test file that is absent. Existing pure validation and dialog tests cover parts of the schedule contract, but no matching file proves the full listed UI acceptance matrix. | Left task unchecked; UI-specific traceability is PARTIAL. No requirement changed. |

## Coverage and consistency

- FR-to-task mapping: 29/29 requirements mapped in the task coverage table.
- SC-to-task mapping: 11/11 success criteria mapped in the task coverage table.
- Requirement-to-test evidence is recorded in `traceability.md`; tests were inspected statically only.
- Clarifications: zero open ambiguities for F12 scope, citing D-23 and the final F12 PO record. P2's Trainer capability question remains explicitly outside F12 (FR-022).
- Task status: T050/T051/T053/T054 remain unchecked. The migration and T050 integration assertions exist, but this lane did not execute tests; the UI evidence named by T053 is missing. No task status was changed.

## Verdict

**PASS WITH MEDIUM EVIDENCE GAPS** — 0 CRITICAL, 0 HIGH, 2 MEDIUM; 40/40 FR/SC items mapped to tasks. Static code/test evidence only; no test suite execution.
