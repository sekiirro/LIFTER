# Analyze — F11 client accounts

- Date: 2026-11-04
- Scope: S33-PO-4 test-only recovery RLS probe bounding and diagnostics (T900).
- Spec: Existing FR-008 and FR-012 and their Given/When/Then recovery/authorization scenarios remain unchanged. The S33 clarification is recorded in `spec.md` and explicitly leaves ND-F5-1/B4 open.
- Plan: S33 plan section scopes work to test probes and failure diagnostics; no client recovery behavior or authorization policy changes.
- Tasks: T900 is tagged FR-008 and FR-012; synthetic fixtures only.
- Findings: 0 open CRITICAL, 0 open HIGH. No product behavior, permissions, retention, UI, or schema decision is introduced.
- Gate: PASS for S33 test-only work. Existing open F11 decisions remain out of scope.
